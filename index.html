       Lullaby Heist  (GADIG - Fall 2019)

       <img src = "images/LullabyHeistTitle Screen.png" alt = "Lullaby Heist Title Screen Image" 
       style = "width: 384px; height:216px; "></a>
       <br>
       <br>
       Synopsis: Lullaby Heist is a game you play as a feline thief  who has to pull off one last job before bedtime. 
       Of course, no prize worth stealing is left unguarded, the cookie jar is protected by the KPD’s 
       (Kitchen Police Department) wind ups division. Jump, dodge and swipe your way through a 2D stealth 
       platformer of your childhood. Avoid security, sneak past the guards, and don’t forget to complete
       your mission: COOKIES!
      </p>

      <p style = "padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; text-align:left; background-color: #006db7">
       For Lullaby Heist, I led a team of programmers to:
       <br> - Create a working main menu
       <br> - Create a functioning pause menu
       <br> - Implement a working camera
       <br> - Creating a camera effect called the Parallax Effect.  This effect occurs when there are 
       two or more objects of differing images from the player's eye.  When the player moves their character 
       accross the screen, the objects in question move at different speeds in relation to the chracter.  The further 
       away an object is from the camera, the slower it will appear to move.
       <br> This game was created in Unity.

        Synopsis: Bonnie,  a single mother of three, lives alone with her children. Her husband, Clyde, 
        left 15 years ago to "get some cigarettes" , but he never returned. In actuality, he 
        left her to enter the Necronomicon, so that he might ascend to eldritch godhood. Left 
        alone to raise their children, rage builds inside her as she begins to uncover the 
        truth. The kids can take care of themselves for a couple of days, right?

      <p style = "padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px; text-align:left; background-color: #006db7">
       For Necronomicon, I programmed and implemented:
       <br> - A working main menu
       <br> - Functioning in game UI
       <br> - Enemy art work from our art team
       <br> - Creating the ability to swap between weapons using either the scroll wheel 
       or the number buttons to suit player preferences.
