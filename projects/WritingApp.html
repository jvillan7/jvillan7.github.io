	<!--Project Info-->
	<div class = "ptext" style = "background: var(--Writing-col); margin: 4% 0%;">
		<div class = "center" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> Synopsis </div>
		<p>	This case study project acts as a teaching aid and supplements in the development in creative writing for young adults who are eager to learn. </p>
		<p> I was responsible for everything UX related to this project - from user research to wireframing to prototyping and more. </p>

		<div class = "center" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> More Info </div>
		<br> Platform: Mobile
		<br> Software Used: Figma
		<br> Project Duration: October 2021
		<br> Group: Myself; this was a personal project.

	<!--User Research-->
	<div class = "ptext" style = "background: var(--Writing-col); margin: 4% 0%;">
		<div class = "pHeader" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> User Research </div>
		<p> Analyses of similar apps were conducted when  researching for this product. </p>
		<p> Based on this, I found that teaching users based on their learning styles was highly underrated amongst competing products.</p>

	<!--Usability Study-->
	<div class = "ptext" style = "background: var(--Writing-col); margin: 4% 0%;">
		<div class = "pHeader"> The Study Plan </div>
		<p> My goal in this study was to determine if users can complete core tasks within the prototype and determine if the app is easy to use. With this in mind, I chose to focus on the following KPIs: </p>
		- Time on task
		<br> - Conversion Rate
		<br> - System Usability Scale (SUS)
	</div>

	<div class = "ptext" style="background: var(--Writing-col); margin: 4% 0%;">
		<div class = "pHeader"> Study Results and Areas of Improvement </div>
		<p>	After conducting a usability study, I found that some users felt: </p>

		1) Some features should be gutted altogether
		<br> 2) The app could have been more streamlined and easier to navigate
		<br> 3) That they weren’t sure of what the app actually wanted to focus on. Either inspiring writers who know what they’re doing, or teaching new ones
	</div>



	<!--Hi-Fi Arcade Mockup-->
	<div class = "pImage" style = "text-align: center;">
		<img src = "images/temp/Hi-Fi Writing App.PNG" style = "width: 80%; height: auto;" alt = "High-Fidelity Prototype Screenshot" title = "High-Fidelity Prototype">
	</div>


	<div class = "ptext" style = "background: var(--Writing-col); margin: 4% 0%;">
		<div class = "pHeader"> What I Learned and Closing Thoughts </div>
		<p>	I learned that navigation and flow are essential to using applications, regardless of the app’s intent for its users.</p>
		<p> If I were to continue from here, I would work on streamlining the amount of features the app provides to users. This would make it more intuitive and easier to comprehend for newer users. </p>
		<p> As with any program, I belive more testing for increased feedback should be expanded upon for increased accessibility and usability. </p>
