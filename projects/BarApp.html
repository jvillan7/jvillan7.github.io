		<div class = "center" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> Synopsis </div>
		<p>	For this project, I wanted to create an ordering app akin to Grubhub and Uber Eats. Specifically, I wanted to create an app that's specific to bars and restaurants with bars that allows users to order food and drinks from their table without the need for a waiter to take their orders. Users can split the check evenly, pay individually, or pick and choose what they are paying for. </p>
		<p> QR codes are based on each individual table to allow users sitting at the same table to connect to the same instance of the app. </p>
		<p> Users could also gift orders to others with personaliszed messages for their friends or to meet new people. </p>
		<p> I was responsible for everything UX related to this project - from user research to wireframing to prototyping and more. </p>

		<br> Platform: Mobile
		<br> Software Used: Figma
		<br> Project Duration: March 2022 - April 2022
		<br> Group: Myself; this was a personal project.

	<!--User Research-->
	<div class = "ptext" style = "background: var(--Bar-col); margin: 4% 0%; color: black;">
		<div class = "pHeader" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> User Research </div>
		<p> Analyses of similar apps were conducted when  researching for this product. I created a <i><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d-A2FZbTDIli2w6XZVDNWakJSMqYe4uLY5erEn2qAD0/edit?usp=sharing" style = " color: black;">Competitive Audit</a></i> detailing how other, similar apps function.</p>
		<p> Based on this research, I found that general accessebility; user flow; and navigation needed significant improvement from competing products. Interestingly enough, no one app particularly stood out as a leading ordering app; all competitors needed significant improvement in one area or another.</p>

	<!--Usability Study-->
	<div class = "ptext" style = "background: var(--Bar-col); margin: 4% 0%; color: black;">
		<div class = "pHeader"> The Study Plan </div>
		<p> My study's goal was to determine if users can complete core tasks within the prototype and determine the app's easy of use. Thus, I chose to focus on the following KPIs: </p>
		- User Error Rates
		<br> - System Usability Scale (SUS)
		<br> - Use of Navigation vs. Search
	</div>


	<div class = "ptext" style="background: var(--Bar-col); margin: 4% 0%; color: black;">
		<div class = "pHeader"> Study Results and Areas of Improvement </div>
		<p>	After conducting a usability study, I found that some users felt the app should: </p>

		1) Increase emphasis on where users should be able to tap on and navigate to
		<br> 2) Be more responsive when users go to each new screen

	<div class = "ptext" style = "background: var(--Bar-col); margin: 4% 0%; color: black;">
		<div class = "pHeader"> What I Learned and Closing Thoughts </div>
		<p>	I learned that responsiveness, while not essential to the user experience, is still incredibly helpfull, especially with less experienced users.</p>
		<p> If I were to continue from here, I would work on increasing the amount of features the app provides to users, such as further expanding upon splitting the check. </p>
		<p> As with any project, more testing for increased feedback should be expanded upon for better accessibility and usability. </p>
