		<br>
		Currently, research institutions have to either appeal to wealthy backers; 
		the government; universities; or special interest groups in order to be 
		able to conduct scientific studies and projects.  This forces  them to 
		only conduct experiments based on what their backers would like for them 
		to research.
		<br>
		<br>
		My aim would lower the barrier of entry for groups that want to conduct 
		professional experiments of their choosing. ExperimentIn is an app idea 
		which would act as a more professional version of applications such as 
		Patreon or GoFundMe.

		<div class = "pHeader"> Initial Prototyping </div>
		<br> 
		Since this was an application that I was designing entirely on my own, 
		I chose to create an early prototype to figure out how the app would 
		function. I took to working in Adobe XD to start my design. <i> 
		<a style = "color: white;" 
		href = "https://xd.adobe.com/view/94cd75de-e16f-48f8-8873-b538b1918016-c19e/">
		This</a></i> is what I came up with. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Becase this is an early prototype, I chose to use as simple of a design as 
		possible, allowing the user to view different experiments posted by different 
		reserach institutions. From there, a user can click on an experiment to find out 
		more about it. Users would then have the option of being able to contact the 
		experiment's conductors for funding.  
		<br>
		<br>
		I also added in place holders to allow the user to upload their own experiments 
		to be funded.
		<br>
		<br>
		After my initial prototype was finished, I started studying how to create and 
		implement an online database to store all of my users' information.

		<div class = "pHeader"> Google Firebase </div>
		For ExperimentIn, I decided to go with Google Firebase as my online database for 
		storing	and uploading experiments. This is because Google Firebase is one of the 
		most accessible online databases and did not require any payments for my needs,
		unlike some of its competitors.
		<br>
		<br>
		After doing enough research, I was able to do the inital set up in interfacing
		ExperimentIn with Google Firebase. This required me to update several settings 
		in my Gradle Scripts as well as my app's Settings. 
		<br>
		<br>
		All that was left was to upload and access data from within ExperimentIn itself.

		<div class = "pHeader"> Interfacing Firebase with ExperimentIn </div>
		<br>
		This is where most of the difficulties arose in creating ExperimentIn. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Uploading data to my Firebase database was not the most user friendly 
		experience. 
		<br>
		<br>
		This was only really frustrating because there were little to no 
		resources on what I should have been doing to properly access everything 
		akin to an object's setters and getters in Java.
		<br>
		<br>
		Ant the end, I coincluded that I should create multiple java classes to 
		format, upload, and access experiments hosted by users.
