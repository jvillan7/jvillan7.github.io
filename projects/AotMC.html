				<br>
				Anne and Roki traveled to the town of Endis looking to do some simple trading. 
				However, their shopping trip is cut short when a group of cardboard creatures 
				attacks. It's up to them to protect the town and stop this invasion with 
				flinging magical cards!
				<br>
				<br>
				Each enemy is weak to a specific type of magical card, meaning you have to throw
				the right card at the right enemy to deal the most damage to them before they 
				can hurt you!

			<br>
			Since we ended up with more programmers than we needed, my job became much more flexible to program and delegate tasks to other programmers, <i>as well as</i> aid our now smaller Design Team. Whenever I wasn't working with Design Team or 
			programming something myself, I taught and assisted my programming subteam with Unity and asset implementation.

			<br>
			My programming sub-team recieved a number of tasks that I would delegate based on 
			my members' skill and comfort levels, leaving whatever's left to be done by myself. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Thus, I was left with determining the early iterations of a card's trajectory when 
			thrown towards an enemy.

				<div class = "pHeader" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> Card Trajectories </div>
				<br>
				I made the foundation of how a card should work, to be built upon throughout the game's development cycle. Card throwing works as follows:
				<br>
				<br> - When a card is selected (clicked and dragged on), it shall be picked 
					up and folllow the mouse until it is either thrown or put back in the player's hand.
				<br>
				<br> - If anything happened to the card other than getting thrown, it would return to the hand.
				<br>
				<br> - If the card is thrown, its velocity would be computed based on how it was flung, 
				much like the throwing mechanics of Pokeballs work in the mobile game: Pokemon Go.
				I thought of modifying the card's X position based off of where and how quickly the 
				player moved the card on screen via it's Y position. Velocity would be calculated by 
				the function:

					alt = "Card trajectory formula" title = "Card trajectory formula">
				</div>

				<br>
				Because GADIG's Design Team constantly wanted to alter the card throwing mechanics, they 
				were ultimeately changed by numerous other team members while I was assigned other work.

				<div class = "pHeader" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> Writing for 
				Attack of the Magic Cardboard (AotMC) </div>
				<br>
				Because we eneded up with significantly more programmers than we needed, I as tasked 
				with not only programming, but also helping Design Team with writing some of the game's
				dialogue and writing the card descriptions. I helped write and edit the game's dialogue 
				to fit the game's fun and light hearted theming. The main challege I had was figuring
				out how to write card descriptions in order to hint at what specific enemy types they 
				should be thrown at while still fitting the game's atmosphere and not being too direct 
				about it.
				<br>
				<br>
				Full dialogue can be found by playing the game. A link to the game can be found at 
				the bottom of this page.

				<div class = "pHeader" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> Main Menu Design </div>
				<br>
				After working on the writing, I designed the main menu.	My challenge in designing this menu stemmed from having to work around the art already made for it. 
				<br>
				<br> 
				I chose to place the buttons at the top left of the main menu and the game's logo to 
				the right of it. Doing so would help give the art, logo, and buttons enough breathing room for the user to properly take in each of them without cluttering the screen.
				<br>
				<br>
				I also kept the Exit Button away from the others to minimize potential misclicks.

				At the end of the development cycle, work narrowed down to myself, the 
				Programming Director, and the Game Director. I was in charge of implementing 
				dialogue into the game's text progression system; beta testing;	refining UI;
				and aiding with launching the game on 
				<i><a href = "https://gadig.itch.io/attack-of-the-magic-cardboard" style = " color: white;">
				GADIG's itch.io page</a></i> just hours before publicly showcasing it to the rest

				<br>
				If I were to go back in time and do things differently, I would have tried to get 
				to know all of my fellow teammates before and during development more so I could
				more effieciently delegate tasks and guide them to better suit their needs. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Like many large projects, finishing AotMC one came down to a small team of people. 
				In the future, I'll work towards providing my teams better overhead whenever and
				wherever possible.
