		<div class = "center" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> Synopsis </div>
		<p>	This website is used to display information on a team I used to help lead: <i> <a href = "https://www.gmu.edu/org/gadig/" style = "color: white;"> 
		The Game Analysis and Design Interest Group (GADIG)</a></i>. During the Fall 2020 - Spring 2021 semester, I was tasked with 
		maintaining and updating the website as its webmaster. This meant updating the roster of current officers as well as improving the website where I see fit.</p>

		<div class = "center" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> What I programmed and implemented </div>
		<br> - The officers of the<i> <a href = "http://www.gmu.edu/org/gadig/team" style = "color: white;">Meet the Team</a></i> webpage.

		<div class = "pHeader"> Adding Plugins </div>
		<p>	When I was applying for the role of Webmaster, I was asked how I could improve the website. I chose to make the website more of a 
		centralized hub of information, compared to what it currently was. While people may be interested in what <i>
		<a href = "https://www.gmu.edu/org/gadig/" style = "color: white;"> GADIG</a></i> does, they may not know how to join. </p>
		
		<p>Because of this, I chose to add plugins for <!-- Facebook and --> Google Calendar to the website. People could then be up to date with what 
		we are currently working on and how to better contact us. </p>

		<div class = "pHeader"> A Change of Leadership </div>
		<p> With every new school year comes a new set of officers. For this upcoming semester, I communicated with each of the officers, gathering 
		info about themselves and how they became intersted in <i><a href = "https://www.gmu.edu/org/gadig/" style = "color: white;"> GADIG</a></i>.</p>

		<p>I then added all of their information onto the website. This was done by implementing a series of 2D arrays via javascript.</p>

	<div class = "ptext" style = "background: var(--GADIG-bkg-col); margin-bottom: 2%;">
		<div class = "pHeader"> What I learned </div>
		<p>	I learned a bit about how javascript and php work with css to build a website. I also learned a lot about how implementing webiste 
		plugins and how they can make software more interactive for the user.</p>
