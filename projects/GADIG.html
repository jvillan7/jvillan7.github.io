		This website is used to display information on my team: <i> <a href = "https://www.gmu.edu/org/gadig/" style = "color: white;"> 
		The Game Analysis and Design Interest Group (GADIG)</a></i>.  As the current (Fall 2020 - Spring 2021) webmaster, I was tasked with 
		maintaining and updating the website as necessary. This meant updating the roster of current officers as well as improving the website where I see fit.

		<br>
		When I was applying for the role of Webmaster, I was asked how I could improve the website.  I chose to make the website more of a 
		centralized hub of information, compared to what it currently was.  While people may be interested in what <i>
		<a href = "https://www.gmu.edu/org/gadig/" style = "color: white;"> GADIG</a></i> does, they may not know how to join. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Because of this, I chose to add plugins for <!-- Facebook and --> Google Calendar to the website.  People could then be up to date with what 
		we are currently working on and how to better contact us.

		<div class = "pHeader"> A Change of Officers </div>
		<br>
		With every new school year comes a new set of officers.  For this upcoming semester, I communicated with each of the officers, gathering 
		info about themselves and how they became intersted in <i><a href = "https://www.gmu.edu/org/gadig/" style = "color: white;"> GADIG</a></i>.
		<br>
		<br>
		I then added all of their information onto the website. This was done by implementing a series of 2D arrays via javascript.

	<div class = "ptext" style = "background: var(--GADIG-bkg-col);">
		<div class = "pHeader"> What I learned </div>
		<br>
		I learned a bit about how javascript and php work with css to build a website.  I also learned a lot about how implementing webiste 
		plugins and how they can make software more interactive for the user.
