			<p>In making Lullaby Heist, I ended up playing a different role from our previous project, <i><a href = "Necronomicon.html" style = "color: white;"> Necronomicon</a>.</i>
			While I was primarily a programmer then, here I was a leader of a subteam of programmers.  A lot of what I did was teaching new team members how to use our git repository and how to make things in Unity.</p>

			<p>I also helped teach my programmers to use Git. One of the most difficult issues I ran into was making sure everyone's 
			Git repositories were working properly and that they were able to commit and push everytime we made substantial progress.</p>

			<p>Due to time constraints, there were times where I had to provide my programmers with tutorials rather than teach things myself. This 
			included youtube tutorials and providing an example of a working main menu from my experiences in <i><a href = "Necronomicon.html" style = "color: white;">Necronomicon</a>.</i></p>

			<p>In talking with both my team and the Art Team, we were able to implement both a pause) menu and a controls screen.  For Lullaby Heist, 
			my job was to direct my team members to communicate with our Art Team and approve of their implementations of their art.</p>

		<tab style = "text-decoration: underline;"> What I leanred</tab>
		<p>	This was the first time I lead a team of programmers.  As a leader, I learned how to work with programmers of varrying experiences and help them further understand both Unity and Git. </p>

		<p>I came to better understand how to cater to the different needs of my team members and help them grow as programmers. </p>

		<p>Specifically, in helping my programmers out with accesssing Git and using Unity, I was able to reinforce my own knowledge on Git.</p>

		<p>If I were to go back in time and do things differently, I would have tried to get 
		to know all of my fellow teammates before and during development more so I could
		more effieciently delegate tasks and guide them to better suit their needs. </p>
		<p>Like many large projects, finishing AotMC one came down to a small team of people. 
		In the future, I'll work towards providing my teams better overhead whenever and
		wherever possible.</p>
