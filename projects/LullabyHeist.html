			<p>In making Lullaby Heist, I ended up playing a different role from our previous project, <i><a href = "Necronomicon.html" style = "color: white;"> Necronomicon</a>.</i>
			While I was primarily a programmer then, here I was a leader of a subteam of programmers.  A lot of what I did was teaching new team members how to use our git repository and how to make things in Unity.</p>

			<p>I also helped teach my programmers a little bit about using Git.  One of the most difficult issues I ran into was making sure everyone's 
			Git repositories were working properly and that they were able to commit and push everytime we made substantial progress.</p>

			<p>Due to time constraints, there were times where I had to provide my programmers with tutorials rather than teach things myself.  This 
			included youtube tutorials and providing an example of a working main menu from my experiences in <i><a href = "Necronomicon.html" style = "color: white;">Necronomicon</a>.</i></p>

			<p>In talking with both my team and the Art Team, we were able to implement both a pause) menu and a controls screen.  For Lullaby Heist, 
			my job was to direct my team members to communicate with our Art Team and approve of their implementations of their art.</p>

			<p>	This was the first time I lead a team of programmers.  As a leader, I learned how to work with programmers of varrying experiences and help them further understand both Unity and Git. </p>

			<p>I came to better understand how to cater to the different needs of my team members and help them grow as programmers. </p>

			<p>Specifically, in helping my programmers out with accesssing Git and using Unity, I was able to reinforce my own knowledge on Git.</p>

			<tab style = "text-decoration: underline;"> Closing Thoughts</tab>
			<p>	As I was leading this small subteam of programmers, most of what I had to do was look over other people's code. From there, I made sure to only approve of a team member's push if they clearly conveyed how to implement their code and assets into the game.  This 
			was to ensure a smooth integration of my team's code into the final build. </p>

			<p>In order to do this, not only did I ask for my team members to heavily comment their code, I also asked them to wrtie up documentation on how it should work.  This was because some of our code and assets may have to be implemented by GADIG's Design Team, people that may not have coding experience. </p>

			<p>My aim in leading this group was to make sure we had well implemented code that was easy to understand and I'm glad to have accomplished that goal. </p>
