		<br>
		In the year 4025, large mechs are build by cities to protect themselves from other neighboring cities. These “Guardians,” equipped with
		the latest technologies, are extremely powerful, capable of clearing whole buildings. Their citizens worship these Guardians as their protectors.
		After the mech of the Central district passed away, tensions grew among its 4 neighboring cities. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Each city claimed rights to the fallen land 
		and decided that the best way to decide its new owner by Guardian combat. The mech that destroys the most may rebuild the central land as an extension
		of their district.  The rest, is Collateral Damage.

		<br>
		I had to learn both Lua and Core within a small amount of time and be able to pass on my knowledge to fellow programmers quickly so they 
		may be as helpful as myself.
		<br>
		<br>
		Due to Covid-19, Collateral Damage was the first project I worked on remotely.  We communicated through Discord and much like previous 
		projects, used Git for version control.		
		<br>
		<br>
		Due to many complications including the ones stated above, this was one of the most complex projects I have worked on thus far in terms 
		of being able to work with other teammates.  Version control through Git and its interactions with Core made development especially tricky.

		<br>
		<br>
		Collateral Damage is GADIG's first time working on an entirely new game engine and language outside of Unity and C++ respectively.  The primary 
		difficulty I ran into was having to both learn a new language and engine, <i>and</i> be able to simultaneously teach them to fellow programmers
		that may not be as experienced as myself.  
		<br>
		<br>
		So for me, Collateral Damage really started in December before even getting access to Core's Closed Beta.  By the time GADIG started working on 
		Collateral Damage, I was able to comfortably teach and walk programmers through some tutorials on both Core and Lua.
		<br>
		<br>
		Working in Core was an incredibly interesting experience for me because I had to perform the roles of both a student and a teacher, constantly 
		learning the ins and outs of Core while also being able to teach others about the basics.

		<br>
		<br>
		For Core, creating and impelmenting the in-game UI was much more fidgety then other programs that allow you to create UI such as Unity, Adobe XD, etc.
		<br>
		<br>
		Like my previous projects in <i><a href = "Necronomicon.html">Necronomicon</a></i> and <i><a href = "LullabyHeist.html">Lullaby Heist</a></i>, I 
		planned to work with GADIG's Art Team to figure out what the HUD should look like.  This time, since all GADIG members were tasked with working in 
		engine (incredibly unlike previous projects), I was instead given assets implement and make functional.  My job then became to adjust the artwork
		so that it would properly display in-game information.
		<br>
		<br>
		The HUD's design displays a strong focus on providing the player with as much information as possible with as little visual noise as possible, exactly in 
		line with the last first person game I programmed for, <i><a href = "Necronomicon.html"> Necronomicon</a></i>.

	<!--Costume Implementation-->

		<tab style = "text-decoration: underline;">Costume Implementation</tab>
		<br>
		<br>
		GADIG's Art Team was able to design robotic armor for the player to equip as a costume. However, they ended up making a lot more art than expected.
		So, instead of fine tuning each costume to properly fit onto the player, I was able to figure outa work around.  I knew that all of our members 
		were working in engine, so I ended up writing a <i><a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SvFmL0dJTKJ8mA_iHccyu437DdQ3c6HVSPt3D_gGxRc/edit?usp=sharing">tutorial</a></i> based off of my experiences in adjusting in-game models and objects myself.
		<br>
		<br>
		From there, I was able to put them into a build of the game.  This was donw by aquiring Art Team's assets, then putting them into an object with a 
		script that will constnatly spawn an object in a space if there isn't one already.  That way, the player will be able to choose from the various 
		costumes before a match begins.

	<!--Game State Manager-->
	<div class = "ptext" style = "background: var(--Collateral-bkg-col);"> 
		<tab style = "text-decoration: underline;">Game State Manager</tab>
		<br>
		<br>
		At the time of making Collateral Damage, Core did not have a way of smoothly transitioning from the start of a round ot the end of one and vice versa.
		There was a way to go from one game state (say, before a game starts) to another (the start of a match).  However, all it did was 
		implement a timer and display the current game state.  
		<br>
		<br>
		My aim in Collateral Damage was to have a sort of ready room for players to 
		equip different costumes before a match starts, then teleport them to the start of the game once they were ready.  
		<br>
		<br>
		So I programmed a way for players to teleport between the ready room and the game's stage and also fleshed out the game state timers to 
		allow our Design Team to more easily customize the length of a round and amount of time before said round.

		<br>
		<br>
		Making a game in Core can be summed up as drawing from a hodge podge of systems resulting in an odd amalgamation that's supposed to be a game.
		Sometimes it works out really well; other times you end up with a product unlike anything you were expecting.
		<br>
		<br>
		That aside, I was able to quickly pick up an entirely new engine and programming language <i> and </i> be able to teach others how to use them
		from scratch.

		<br>
		<br>
		This was the most ambitious project I have ever attempted thus far.  Perservering through the difficulties that 2020 brought along with working in 
		a new engine and programming language was 
		<br>
		<br>
		While I was able to complete my tasks, I cannot say the same thing about everyone.  The transition to working solely online while 
		still having to keep up with our studies as students became highly discouraging to a number of GADIG's members.
		This got to the point where some of our members left GADIG for the semester, leaving the rest of us to pick up 
		where they left off.  
		<br>
		<br>
		Sadly, we were not able to finish the game based off of our original designs, such as creating a map with a
		destructive environment without negatively impacting the computer's performance and implementing working powerups.
		<br>
		<br>
		If we were given another chance to start from scratch, I believe we could easily develop our game by streamlining 
		some of our design decisions.
