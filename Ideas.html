			Here are some smaller projects I have recently created. These are just some of the mockups and prototypes I made while on my 100 day Daily UI Challenges journey. All of these and more can be found on my <i><a href = "https://dribbble.com/jvillan7" style = "color: white;">Dribbble page here</a></i>. Lorem Ipsum and placeholder images were used where applicable.

			<p>I drew inspiration from Google Keep Notes's interface. For my idea, I streamlined all navigation elements. Sticky notes are spaced out into a two column layout. </p>

			<p>Larger notes have ellipses to convey its length. This allows the user too many notes as they have made as possible, regardless of note length. </p>

			<p>All elements that are not immediately required for most user journeys are placed in the settings menu via the hamburger icons in the top right of the screens.</p>

			<p>A potential blog posting app with various color themes. Navigation buttons are at the bottom of the screen for an ergonomic design.</p>

			<p>For this challenge, I created a similar experience a previous <a href = "https://dribbble.com/shots/16308534-Daily-UI-007-Settings" style = "color: white;">challenge: Making a Settings Menu</a>.</p>

			<p>I provided a sidebar to act as the main navigation menu with different tabs; different sections for each tab; and a search bar at the top for easy access.</p>

			<p>I think the idea of a favorites option can only really act as an addition or enhancement to the core experience of an existing app. Exactly why I used this to expand on a <a href = "" style = "color: white">previous idea</a>.</p>

			<p>The Favorites Screen showcases the user's favorite food and drink options.</p>

			<p>I chose to go with a simple, streamlined approach to the usually cluttered boarding passes.</p>

			<p>I wanted the screen to read like a book, personal information at the top like a title with more relevant information front and center. Boarding Time has its own section at the top because most users will check on it before entering the airport and a few times to double check their time when they're already at or near their gate. It is not as relevant as the rest of the information on screen.</p>
