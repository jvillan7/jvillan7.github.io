		<br>
		Morgs Mimics and Mansions Munchables (MMMM) is a game where you play as Morg,
	a mimic who wants to overthrow the current Mimic Monarch to seize the throne! To do 
	so, you must amass a large enough base of followers and prove to them that you can 
	provide a steady source of food, humans.

		<br> Several of the various Mimics in the game:
		<br> - Skitter Mimic - Programming
		<br> - Fungal Mimic - Task Delegation
		<br> - Sleepy Mimic - Animation
		<br>
		<br> I also worked with GADIG's Design Team to improve the accessability of the 
		various menus in the title screen.

		<br>
		<br>
		When we first started making MMMM, I took initiative in becoming the lead programmer
		in designing each of the various Mimics to be implemented in the game. At the time, 
		our design team was stil determining the types of mimics they wanted to see in the 
		game. So, I directed a small sub team of programmers to make a generic, polymorphic 
		mimic interface to be used by all other mimic classes. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<a href = "images/MMMM/InitialPlanning.PNG">Here</a> was my inital plan for the 
		overall workflow of our project. Because I was the only one on my team with experience
		in Unity and C#, 
		<a href = "images/MMMM/InitialSources.PNG">this</a> was my inital idea of where my
		team members could start doing research.  
		<br>
		<br>
		Unfortunately my teammates eventually became unavailable due to their external 
		commitments and stopped contributing before they could start. Thus, I 
		shouldered the workload on my own.  
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<tab style = "text-decoration: underline;"> Programming Generic Mimics </tab>
		<br>
		<br>
		The difficulty in programming a generic mimic interface was that could accomodate for 
		whatever Design Team would throw at me. I knew that Design Team would most likely
		design mimics that change and alter how mimics behave, so I wanted to make sure 
		we first had a baseline of what mimics should do.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		After talking with Design Team, we determined mimics must:
		<br> - Look for humans to eat
		<br> - Attempt to eat nearby humans 
		<br> - Take some amount of time to eat humans
		<br> - Take some amount of time digesting its food before it can look for humans 
		to eat again
		<br>
		<br>
		<br> 
		With all of this in mind, I created different mimic 'states' utilizing a combination
		of enums and booleans to determine what a the current state a mimic was in. Each
		type of mimic would likely have their own unique eating and digesting times.  So, I
		made sure to make those variables customizable for when we make unique mimics. I also
		included an attack range for mimics because that could easily change from unique mimic 
		to mimic.
		<br>
		<br>
		All that was left was to wait and see what unique mimics Design Team would come up with
		so I could program them.

		<br>
		<br>
		The first mimic I was tasked to program was the Skitter Mimic.  This mimic would be 
		able to crawl across the floor to hunt for its prey. 
		<br>
		<br>
		The difficulty in creating this mimic was not getting mimic to move, but rather 
		getting it to stop.  Whenever a human would get in range of the Skitter Mimc, the 
		mimic should run up to the human, eat, then return to its starting position to 
		digest its food and to look for more humans to eat.
		<br>
		<br>
		There was one significant bugs in programming the Skitter Mimic.  When the Skitter 
		would run to eat a person, it would instead look for more humans to eat from its 
		current position rather than from it's starting position. While this was a rare bug
		to encounter, it was important to solve nonetheless.
		<br>
		<br>
		After some trial and error, I solved the bug by significantly increasing the checks 
		to the mimic's current state and the mimic's current position.

		<br>
		<br>
		The Sleepy Mimic is the only mimic I did not plan to have any direct involvement with.
		One of my original team members was believed to come back to work on the project. So to 
		make up for lost time, I created a 

		<a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XVQMn2mc9c_omTHqgtC4cl9EM4pnlIgE/view?usp=sharing">
		diagram</a> 

		outlining the different states that the Sleepy Mimic would go through in a typical game loop.  
		<br>
		<br>
		To make sure I didn't lose any time on working on the Skitter Mimic, I made Sleepy
		Mimic diagram concurrently with my work on the Skitter Mimic.
		<br>
		<br>
		Unfortunately my teammate back ended up not being able to contribute to the project due 
		to external commitments. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Luckily, the Sleepy Mimic was primarily about manipulating the different states of the 
		original mimic interface I made at the start of development. This meant that all that 
		needed to be done was manipulate some of the values and include a new state called 
		MimicState.Sleeping to determine whether or not the Sleepy Mimic was sleeping.

		Lastly, by the time I could get to programming the Fungal Mimic, it was already finished by 
		GADIG's Programming Director. So at this point, I was tasked with implementing the Fungal 
		Mimic's animations via Unity's Animator. 
		<br>
		<br>
		This was a simple task with my experiences working on 
		<a href = "Necronomicon.html">Necronomicon</a>
		For this project, I used the sprite sheets for the Fungal Mimic provided by Art Team, put them
		into Unity's Animation, then used Unity's Animator to create the different animation states.
		After that all I had to do was incorporate the animation states into the Fungal Mimic's code.

		<tab style = "text-decoration: underline;"> The Title Screen</tab>
		<br>
		<br>
		When talking with Design Team about the main menu's screens after recieveing Title 
		Screen art for the game, I believed that there was room for improvement. While I 
		personally did not work on programming the various menus screens, I chose to provide 
		feedback from a User Experience standpoint. 
		<br>
		<br>
		When designing a main menu I believe that accessibility is of the utmost importance. 
		For MMMM, this meant granting the Play Button the highest salience by giving it 
		larger than the rest of the buttons and centering it.  
		<br>
		<br>
		When someone looks at an image for the first time they typically start looking at 
		it from the center.  In the main menu, this means looking at the Skitter Mimic. 
		The gray slits on top of its eyes help guide the player's down directly to the Play 
		Button - the most important button to access when opening up any game. 
		<br>
		<br> 
		<br>
		<br>
		From there, the players eyes will likely go to either the How To Play Button or the 
		Options Button - buttons that have a slightly lower priority than the Play Button. 
		These two buttons still maintain a relatively high priority because they are the two
		buttons that newer players might be interested in opening instead of the Play Button.
		<br>
		<br>
		The Exit Button and the Credit Buttons deserve the lowest priority because they are 
		buttons that would typically only be pressed once during the typical user's play 
		session. While arguments can be made for the Exit Button having a higher priority 
		than other buttons due to it being something that should be pressed every play 
		session, I think putting it in the upper left hand corner was the right idea. For the 
		bottom three buttons, I chose to maintain the ideas of
		<i><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">Memory Chunking</a></i>
		and the 
		<i><a href = "https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/laws-of-proximity-uniform-connectedness-and-continuation-gestalt-principles-2">
		Law of Proximity</a></i>
		and limited the bottom part of the screen to only 3 buttons with decent spacing 
		instead of upwards of 5 clustered buttons.

	<div class = "ptext" style = "background: var(--MMMM-bkg-col);">
		Above is what the original Controls Screen looked like orginally. I believed that we 
		could easily expand upon this screen for accessibility. More specifically, I wanted
		to increase the ease of use and how quickly a player can start the actual game.
		<br>
		<br>
		I also wanted to expand upton this creen to more properly cover the features in MMMM. 
		On top of the mimic system, there is also the lesser known feature of scaring humans by 
		clicking on furniture that do not contian mimics.  However, I wanted to make sure the 
		instructions were as simple as possible. This meant that I had allow the player to 
		navigate to a second screen with the rest of the instructions.

		<br>
		This is what we came up with:
